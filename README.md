# IC Hacks (FPGA Track) Template Guide
This template provies an easy to use Verilog/SystemVerilog simulation workflow, managed entirely through github actions. 

### IMPORTANT NOTE
Only modify the `/src` and the `/test` directories. **DO NOT** modify files in any other directory. Modifying other files **WILL** break the simulation workflow and may also lead to merge conflicts.

See the `Expected Repository Structure` section below.

# How to use the Repository

### Clone and Prepare the Repository
Click `Use this template` &rarr; `Create a new repository`

### Enable GitHub Actions to Build the Results Page
Go to your newly created repository and allow actions to create GitHub pages.

`Settings` &rarr; `Pages` &rarr; `Build and Deployment` &rarr; `GitHub Actions`

## Set up your Verilog/Systemverilog Project

1. Add your Verilog/Systemverilog source files to the `/src`. A  wrapper for the DE1-SoC FPGA board is provided at `/src/de1soc_wrapper.sv`. The top module in `/src` must be named `top`.

2. Add your testbench to `/test/tb.sv`. The testbench module must be named `tb`. 

## Expected Repository Structure
```
│
├── src/            # ALL design source files (.v or .sv)
│ ├── top.sv
│ ├── module_a.v
│ └── ...
│
├── test/
│ └── tb.sv         # MUST be named exactly tb.sv
│
├── assets/         # Images for README
│
├── .github/
│ ├── workflows/    # GitHub Actions (do not modify)
│ └── outputs/      # Auto-generated simulation outputs
│
└── README.md
```

# Push your Repository and View Actions
Once you push the repository, it will trigger a GitHub Action workflow that runs the simulation and generates the output files.

Once your design passes the testbench, you can view the outputs under:

`Actions` &rarr; `<name of your last commit>`

## Viewing your Waveforms
You can view the outputs generated by the actions in `.github/outputs/`. 
- `sim.log`: verilator text output
- `wave.vcd`: waveform file (can view in surfer)
- `wave.svg`: image preview of the waveform
- `wave.json`: used to generate the image preview (don't worry about this)

A preview of your waveform will also be generated in the **Actions Summary**. 

If you want to inspect the waveforms more closely you can use `surfer`:
1. Go to https://app.surfer-project.org/
2. `Files` &rarr; `Open URL` &rarr; `<URL to your wave.vcd (autogenerated)>`

The URL to your `wave.vcd` file will be generated automatically in the **Actions Summary**.
